<p>OpenCon is more than a conference. It’s a community supported through active forums, programs and events that are open to everyone – and we encourage you to get involved right away. Below are some ideas to get started.</p>

<p><strong>Top 4 Ways to Get Involved with OpenCon</strong></p>

<p><strong>(1) RSVP to attend OpenCon Live.</strong> Even if you are not invited to attend in person, you can still participate remotely in OpenCon 2016 through OpenCon Live. Let us know that you plan to participate in OpenCon 2016 either way by submitting your RSVP: <a href="http://www.opencon2016.org/opencon_2016_live">http://www.opencon2016.org/opencon_2016_live</a></p>

<p><strong>(2) Host or attend an OpenCon Satellite Event.</strong> You can help build the movement by organizing or attending a satellite event. Satellites can be of any size, in any place, at any time and are open to anyone. They typically combine content, themes and ideas from the main meeting with locally arranged activities, and are a great way to get more involved. Sign up to host or attend a Satellite Event here: <a href="http://www.opencon2016.org/satellite">http://www.opencon2016.org/satellite</a></p>

<p><strong>(3) Explore the OpenCon Community.</strong> OpenCon brings together students, early career researchers and more from across the world for discussion and action around Open Access, Open Data and Open Education. Connect with the global OpenCon community through our Discussion List, Community Calls and Webcasts.

<p><strong>(4) Share your reasons for applying to OpenCon online.</strong> In the spirit of openness, we encourage everyone who applies to share why Open is important to you, and how you would use your experience at OpenCon to have an impact. You can use your answers to the short answer questions in your application as a starting point.
